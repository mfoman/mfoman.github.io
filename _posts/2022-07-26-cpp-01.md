**Unfinished:** Article is not done yet.
{: .notice--warning}

**Disclaimer:** This is a series of posts about C++. It's mainly for me to learn C++, but just as much for me to be able to teach others.
I will be using only one convention when talking about certain topics. Meaning that I will only name alternative
methods if I deem it fitting. So just treat my word as law and of course lookup the facts and prove me wrong.

# Introduction

I will not tell you what you already know.
I'll teach you C++ and challenge you to learn it.

# Goal for today

1. Learn the basics of C++
    1. Variables
    2. Functions
    3. Classes

2. Use the language to solve a problem: dynamic connectivity
    1. Problem
    2. Union Find
    3. Use Case

## 1. Learn the basics of C++

### 1. Variables

```cpp
// main.cpp
#include <iostream>     // preprocessor directive

// main function - must have signature of int main()
// char *argv[] is a pointer to an array of char
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

    int a{3};           // direct initialization
    int b{4};           // better on 2 lines than on 1 line

    int guess{};        // zero initialization - 0

    // Console output with << insertion operator
    std::cout << "How many primitive types are in c++?: ";

    // User input with >> extraction operator
    std::cin >> guess;

    if (guess == a + b) {
        std::cout << "Correct, is 7!" << std::endl;
    } else {
        // \n does the same as std::endl
        // but doesn't flush the buffer
        std::cout << "Wrong!\n";
    }

    return 0;          // value of 0 indicates success

}
```

The primitive types are: `int, float, double, char, bool, void and wchar_t`.

Several of the types can be modified as: `signed, unsigned, short and long`.
