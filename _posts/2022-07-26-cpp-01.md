**Unfinished:** Article is not done yet.

**Disclaimer:** This is a series of posts about C++. It's mainly for me to learn C++, but just as much for me to be able to teach others.
I will be using only one convention when talking about certain topics. Meaning that I will only name alternative
methods if I deem it fitting. So just treat my word as law and of course lookup the facts and prove me wrong.

# Video

For now I will share Cherno's videoes about C++, until I get around to create my own. The whole series is worth watching.

# Introduction

I will not tell you what you already know.
I'll teach you C++ and challenge you to learn it.

# Goal for today

1. Learn the basics of C++
    1. Variables
    2. Functions
    3. Classes

2. Use the language to solve a problem: dynamic connectivity
    1. Problem
    2. Union Find
    3. Use Case

## 1. Learn the basics of C++

### 1. Variables

```cpp
// main.cpp

// Preprocessor Directive
// iostream is part of std and allows use of cout & cin.
#include <iostream>     

// main function - must have signature of int main()
// char *argv[] is a pointer to an array of char
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

    int a{3};           // direct brace initialization
    int b{4};           // better on 2 lines than on 1 line

    int guess{};        // zero initialization - 0

    // Console output with << insertion operator
    std::cout << "How many primitive types are in c++?: ";

    // User input with >> extraction operator
    std::cin >> guess;

    if (guess == a + b) {
        std::cout << "Correct, it's 7!" << std::endl;
    } else {
        // \n does the same as std::endl
        // but doesn't flush the buffer
        std::cout << "Wrong!\n";
    }

    return 0;          // value of 0 indicates success

}
```

The primitive types(7) are: `float, int, double, char, bool, void and wchar_t`.

**Mnemonic:** `FIdo, the Dog, Chases Ball Very Waggy`

**Info:** `wchar_t` is a wide character type, used to store characters that are not in the ASCII range(255).
It is most widely used in Windows. It's fixed width, multi-byte encoding. It's now more common to use `char` with
variable-width encodings like `UTF-8`.
{: .notice--info}

Several of the types can be modified as: `signed, unsigned, short and long`.
